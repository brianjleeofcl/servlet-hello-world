# Servlet & JSP Hello Workd

This application is a very brief hello world application using Java Servlets and JSP.

While the actual servlet POJO was not difficult to get started with, the configuration of a servlet container proved rather difficult.
To remedy this, this application uses the `gretty` Gradle plugin.
To launch the application, use `./gradlew appRun` command from the terminal.
The default location should be `localhost:8080/servlet`.
